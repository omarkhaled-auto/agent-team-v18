## FRONTEND CODE QUALITY STANDARDS (ALWAYS APPLIED)

LLMs produce tutorial-quality frontend code by default. These standards enforce production quality.

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER produce these)

**FRONT-001: Components Inside Render**
- NEVER define components inside other components' render functions.
- Inner components re-mount on every render, destroying state and killing performance.
- FIX: Extract to separate file or define at module scope.

**FRONT-002: God Components**
- NEVER write components exceeding 200 LOC or handling multiple responsibilities.
- FIX: Split by responsibility. One component = one job.

**FRONT-003: Derived State in useState**
- NEVER use useState + useEffect to compute values derivable from existing state/props.
- FIX: Compute during render: `const fullName = first + ' ' + last;`

**FRONT-004: useEffect for Everything**
- NEVER use useEffect for synchronous derivations or event-driven logic.
- FIX: Derive in render for computed values. Use event handlers for user actions.

**FRONT-005: Missing Effect Cleanup**
- NEVER leave useEffect without cleanup for subscriptions, timers, or fetch calls.
- FIX: Return cleanup function. Use AbortController for fetch. Cancel timers.

**FRONT-006: Stale Closures**
- NEVER omit dependencies from useCallback/useEffect/useMemo dependency arrays.
- FIX: Include all referenced variables. Use the exhaustive-deps lint rule.

**FRONT-007: any Type Abuse**
- NEVER use TypeScript `any` as a shortcut. It defeats the type system entirely.
- FIX: Use `unknown` + type guards, proper generics, or specific types.

**FRONT-008: Prop Drilling**
- NEVER pass props through 3+ component layers just to reach a deep child.
- FIX: Use Context, composition (children), or state management for deep data.

**FRONT-009: Waterfall Requests**
- NEVER chain sequential fetches that could run in parallel.
- FIX: Use Promise.all, parallel queries, or data loaders.

**FRONT-010: Missing Error Boundaries**
- NEVER leave component trees without error boundaries — one error whites out the screen.
- FIX: Wrap route-level and feature-level boundaries. Provide fallback UI.

**FRONT-011: Index/Random Keys**
- NEVER use `key={index}` on dynamic lists or `key={Math.random()}`.
- FIX: Use stable, unique identifiers from data (id, slug, etc.).

**FRONT-012: Unnecessary Re-renders**
- NEVER ignore re-render costs on expensive child components.
- FIX: Use React.memo for pure display components. Memoize callbacks passed as props.

**FRONT-013: Business Logic in UI**
- NEVER put API calls, complex validation, or data transformation inside components.
- FIX: Extract to hooks, services, or utility modules. Components render, hooks orchestrate.

**FRONT-014: Missing Loading/Error States**
- NEVER show blank screens during data loading or after errors.
- FIX: Every async UI needs: loading skeleton, error message with retry, empty state.

**FRONT-015: Div Instead of Semantic HTML**
- NEVER use `<div onClick>` when `<button>` exists. Never use `<div>` for navigation.
- FIX: Use semantic elements: button, a, nav, main, section, article, header, footer.

**FRONT-016: Duplicated Helper Functions**
- NEVER define the same helper function in two or more files.
- FIX: Extract to a shared `src/lib/` or `src/utils/` module and import from there.

**FRONT-017: No Max-Length on String Inputs**
- NEVER validate strings with only `z.string().min(1)` without a `.max()` constraint.
- FIX: Add `.max(500)` for short fields, `.max(2048)` for URLs/descriptions, appropriate limits for each field.

**FRONT-018: No URL Protocol Restriction**
- NEVER accept URLs with `z.string().url()` without restricting the protocol.
- `z.string().url()` accepts `file://`, `javascript:`, and other dangerous schemes.
- FIX: `.refine(url => url.startsWith('http'))` or use a custom URL validator that only allows http/https.

**FRONT-019: Mock Data in Services**
- NEVER use mock/stub/fake data in service files. Never use `of(mockData)`, `delay()` to simulate API calls, or hardcoded arrays as data sources.
- Every service method MUST make a REAL HTTP call to the backend API.
- FIX: Use HttpClient.get/post/put/delete with proper URLs. Map response DTOs to frontend models.
- If the backend endpoint doesn't exist yet, flag it as a blocker — do NOT create fake data.

**FRONT-020: DTO/Enum Mismatch**
- NEVER assume frontend enum values match backend enum values without verification.
- Backend may return numeric enums (0, 1, 2) while frontend uses string enums ('admin', 'manager').
- FIX: Create mapping functions (mapApiRole, mapTenderStatus) in model files. Apply in services.

**FRONT-021: Hardcoded Service Responses**
- NEVER return hardcoded objects from service methods. Every method must call a real API endpoint.
- Patterns to AVOID: `return of({...})`, `return new Observable(sub => sub.next({...}))`, `return Promise.resolve({...})`
- FIX: Return `this.http.get<T>(url)` or equivalent real HTTP call.

**FRONT-022: Defensive Response Shape Handling**
- NEVER use defensive patterns like `Array.isArray(res) ? res : res.data || []` to handle
  inconsistent backend response shapes. This masks a backend bug.
- If the frontend needs defensive handling, the backend response shape is wrong — fix the backend.
- FIX: Backend list endpoints MUST return `{ data: T[], meta: {...} }`. Frontend destructures `const { data, meta } = response`.

**FRONT-023: Hardcoded Role/Enum Values Without Registry Import**
- NEVER hardcode role names or enum values as string literals scattered across components.
- Role strings like `'technician'` in frontend MUST match the DB seed exactly (`'maintenance_tech'`).
- FIX: Create a shared constants file (`roles.ts`, `enums.ts`) sourced from the Enum Registry.
  Import and reference constants, never raw strings.

**FRONT-024: Auth Flow Assumption Without Contract**
- NEVER implement an auth flow (login, MFA, token refresh) based on assumptions about the backend.
- If frontend expects challenge-token MFA but backend expects inline MFA code = locked-out users.
- FIX: Read the auth contract documentation in REQUIREMENTS.md FIRST. Implement the EXACT flow
  documented. If no contract exists, flag it as a blocker for the architect.

### Quality Rules

**State Management:**
- Colocate state. Lift only when truly shared. URL state for navigation-relevant values.
- Server state belongs in a cache layer (React Query, SWR), not useState.

**TypeScript:**
- Discriminated unions over optional fields. Narrow types at boundaries.
- Export types alongside components. No implicit any.

**Performance:**
- Virtualize lists > 100 items. Lazy-load routes and heavy components.
- Debounce user input. Avoid layout thrashing (batch DOM reads/writes).

**Accessibility:**
- Every interactive element keyboard-accessible. ARIA labels on icon-only buttons.
- Focus management on modals/dialogs. Color is never the ONLY indicator.

BACKEND_STANDARDS = r"""
## BACKEND CODE QUALITY STANDARDS (ALWAYS APPLIED)

LLMs generate tutorial-quality backend code by default. These standards enforce production quality.

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER produce these)

**BACK-001: SQL/NoSQL Injection**
- NEVER concatenate user input into query strings.
- FIX: Use parameterized queries, prepared statements, or ORM query builders.

**BACK-002: N+1 Queries**
- NEVER fetch a list then loop to query each item individually.
- FIX: Use eager loading, JOINs, batch fetches, or DataLoader pattern.

**BACK-003: Broad Exception Catch**
- NEVER write `catch(error) {}` or bare `except:` that swallows all errors silently.
- FIX: Catch specific exceptions. Log unexpected ones. Re-raise what you can't handle.

**BACK-004: Leaking Internal Errors**
- NEVER return stack traces, SQL errors, or internal paths in API responses.
- FIX: Map to generic messages in production. Log full details server-side.

**BACK-005: Missing Pagination**
- NEVER return an entire dataset without limit/offset or cursor pagination.
- FIX: Default page size. Max page size cap. Return total count and next cursor.

**BACK-006: Broken Object Authorization (IDOR)**
- NEVER access resources by ID without verifying the requester owns/can access them.
- FIX: Check ownership/permissions before every data access. Filter queries by user.

**BACK-007: Hardcoded Secrets**
- NEVER put API keys, passwords, or tokens directly in source code.
- FIX: Use environment variables, secret managers, or encrypted config.

**BACK-008: Missing Input Validation**
- NEVER trust client input without validation at the API boundary.
- FIX: Validate type, format, length, range. Use schema validation (Zod, Pydantic, Joi).

**BACK-009: No Rate Limiting**
- NEVER expose endpoints without rate limiting — especially auth and write operations.
- FIX: Apply rate limiting middleware. Stricter on auth endpoints.

**BACK-010: Missing Indexes**
- NEVER query columns used in WHERE/JOIN/ORDER BY without database indexes.
- FIX: Add indexes for query patterns. Monitor slow query logs.

**BACK-011: Synchronous Blocking**
- NEVER use synchronous I/O (readFileSync, synchronous HTTP) in request handlers.
- FIX: Use async/await for all I/O operations. Offload CPU-heavy work to workers.

**BACK-012: No Structured Logging**
- NEVER use console.log with plain strings in production code. Never log secrets.
- FIX: Use structured logging (JSON format) with levels, correlation IDs, and context.

**BACK-013: Missing Health Checks**
- NEVER deploy services without /health and /readiness endpoints.
- FIX: Health checks verify connectivity to dependencies. Return structured status.

**BACK-014: No Idempotency**
- NEVER allow retry of POST/PUT to create duplicate records or side effects.
- FIX: Use idempotency keys. Make operations safe to retry.

**BACK-015: SSRF Vulnerability**
- NEVER fetch user-supplied URLs without validation and allowlisting.
- FIX: Validate URL scheme and host. Block internal network ranges. Use allowlists.

**BACK-016: Non-transactional Multi-Step Writes**
- NEVER perform sequential deleteMany + createMany (or delete + create) without wrapping in a transaction.
- FIX: Use `$transaction()` (Prisma), `db.session` (SQLAlchemy), or equivalent atomic wrapper.

**BACK-017: Validation Result Discarded**
- NEVER call `schema.parse(body)` or `schema.validate(body)` without assigning the result.
- The parsed result contains sanitized data; ignoring it means raw input flows downstream.
- FIX: `req.body = schema.parse(req.body)` — always use the parsed/sanitized output.

**BACK-018: Unvalidated Route Parameters**
- NEVER use `Number(req.params.id)` or `parseInt(req.params.id)` without checking for NaN.
- FIX: Validate immediately after parsing; return 400 on invalid (e.g., `if (isNaN(id)) return res.status(400)...`).

**BACK-019: Unvalidated FK References**
- NEVER accept foreign key IDs from client input without verifying the referenced entity exists.
- FIX: Query the referenced entity first; return 404 if not found before proceeding with the operation.

**BACK-020: Manual Partial Schema**
- NEVER manually make each field optional when creating an update/patch schema.
- FIX: Use `createSchema.partial()` (Zod), `schema.copy(update=...)` (Pydantic), or equivalent.

**BACK-021: Missing Cascade on Parent-Child Relations**
- NEVER define a parent-child relationship without `onDelete: Cascade` (or appropriate cascade rule).
- Without cascade, deleting a parent throws FK constraint errors or leaves orphaned child rows.
- FIX: Add `onDelete: Cascade` to `@relation` (Prisma), `cascade: true` (TypeORM), or `ON DELETE CASCADE` (raw SQL).

**BACK-022: Bare FK Field Without @relation**
- NEVER leave a field ending in `_id` without a corresponding `@relation` annotation or relationship decorator.
- A bare `_id` field means: no referential integrity, no cascade behavior, no ORM join/include queries.
- FIX: Add `@relation` (Prisma), `@ManyToOne`/`@OneToOne` (TypeORM), or `relationship()` (SQLAlchemy).

**BACK-023: Invalid Default on FK Field**
- NEVER use `@default("")` on a foreign key field. An empty string is not a valid UUID.
- This causes FK constraint violations at insert time or broken joins at query time.
- FIX: Use nullable (`String?`) with no default, or remove the default entirely.

**BACK-024: Missing Soft-Delete Filter**
- NEVER query a model with `deleted_at` without filtering `deleted_at IS NULL`.
- Deleted records appearing in list views is a data integrity bug.
- FIX: Use global middleware that auto-filters. If no middleware, add `where: { deleted_at: null }` to every query.

**BACK-025: Service References Non-Existent Field**
- NEVER filter or include on a field/relation that does not exist on the model.
- `where: { deleted_at: null }` on a model without `deleted_at` causes a runtime ORM error.
- `include: { items: true }` on a model without an `items` relation causes a runtime error.
- FIX: Read the schema/model definition BEFORE writing queries. Verify every field and relation name.

**BACK-026: Invalid UUID Fallback Value**
- NEVER use a non-UUID string like `'no-match'` as a fallback when a UUID lookup fails.
- This causes type validation errors in databases with UUID column types.
- FIX: Throw `BadRequestException`/`NotFoundException` instead of using invalid fallback values.

**BACK-027: Post-Pagination Filtering**
- NEVER apply business filters (e.g., `out_of_stock`, `active_only`) AFTER pagination (`skip`/`take`).
- Post-pagination filtering means: wrong page totals, missing records, and inconsistent `meta.total`.
- FIX: Apply ALL filters in the database `where` clause BEFORE pagination.

**BACK-028: Route Structure Mismatch (Nested vs Top-Level)**
- NEVER call a nested route (`/buildings/:id/floors`) when the backend controller is top-level (`/floors`).
- This causes 404 errors because the nested route simply does not exist.
- FIX: Frontend API paths MUST match the exact controller route prefix. Read the backend controller
  decorator (`@Controller('floors')`) to determine the correct base path.

### Quality Rules

**API Design:**
- Consistent naming: plural nouns for collections, HTTP verbs for actions.
- Standard status codes: 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401/403, 404, 409, 422, 500.
- Versioning strategy from day one. Consistent error response shape.

**Error Handling:**
- Define error hierarchy: base app error, domain errors, infrastructure errors.
- Map internal errors to API responses at the boundary layer only.
- Every async operation needs specific error handling (no bare catch-all).

**Security (OWASP):**
- Validate ALL input at system boundaries. Sanitize output.
- Authentication on every non-public endpoint. Authorization on every data access.
- CORS configured for specific origins only. Security headers set.

**Database:**
- Migrations for all schema changes. Never manual DDL in production.
- Connection pooling. Transaction boundaries match business operations.
- Soft delete with audit trail for user data.

CODE_REVIEW_STANDARDS = r"""
## CODE REVIEW QUALITY STANDARDS (ALWAYS APPLIED)

AI reviewers default to surface-level checks. These standards enforce deep review.

### Review Priority Order
1. **SECURITY** — vulnerabilities, injection, auth bypass, data exposure
2. **CORRECTNESS** — logic errors, edge cases, race conditions, data loss
3. **PERFORMANCE** — N+1 queries, missing indexes, unbounded operations
4. **ARCHITECTURE** — pattern violations, coupling, separation of concerns
5. **TESTING** — coverage gaps, flaky tests, missing edge case tests
6. **STYLE** — naming, formatting, documentation (lowest priority)

NEVER approve code with security issues just because it "works."

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER commit these review failures)

**REVIEW-001: Rubber-Stamp LGTM**
- NEVER approve without reading every changed line. "Looks good" is not a review.

**REVIEW-002: Syntax-Only Review**
- NEVER check only formatting/naming while ignoring logic, edge cases, and security.

**REVIEW-003: Context Blindness**
- NEVER review the diff in isolation. Read surrounding code to understand impact.

**REVIEW-004: Missing Security Check**
- NEVER skip OWASP screening. Check injection, auth, data exposure on every review.

**REVIEW-005: Edge Case Neglect**
- NEVER verify only the happy path. Test: null, empty, boundary, concurrent, error.

**REVIEW-006: Error Path Ignorance**
- NEVER skip tracing failure paths. What happens when the DB is down? API times out?

**REVIEW-007: Hallucinated API Accept**
- NEVER assume API methods exist without verifying. Check that called methods are real.

**REVIEW-008: Cross-File Blindness**
- NEVER ignore how changes impact other files. Check callers, importers, dependents.

**REVIEW-009: Incomplete Requirement**
- NEVER approve partial implementation. Every requirement either FULLY met or FAIL.

**REVIEW-010: Performance Blind Spot**
- NEVER ignore algorithmic complexity. O(n^2) loops, unbounded queries, missing caching.

**REVIEW-011: Test Quality Bypass**
- NEVER accept coverage % without checking test quality. Tests must assert behavior.

**REVIEW-012: Architecture Erosion**
- NEVER accept pattern violations. If the project uses repositories, don't allow direct DB.

**REVIEW-013: Missing Integration Test**
- NEVER skip cross-component verification. Unit tests alone don't catch wiring bugs.

**REVIEW-014: Dependency Blindness**
- NEVER ignore new dependencies. Check for vulnerabilities, license, maintenance status.

**REVIEW-015: Silent Regression**
- NEVER approve without considering if the change breaks existing functionality.

### Severity Classification
Every finding must be classified:
- **CRITICAL** — Security vulnerability, data loss, crash → BLOCKING (must fix before merge)
- **HIGH** — Logic error, missing validation, broken feature → BLOCKING (must fix)
- **MEDIUM** — Performance issue, missing test, pattern violation → Request changes (should fix)
- **LOW** — Style, naming, documentation → Comment (nice to fix, non-blocking)
""".strip()

TESTING_STANDARDS = r"""
## TESTING QUALITY STANDARDS (ALWAYS APPLIED)

AI-generated tests are the single biggest quality gap. These standards enforce meaningful tests.

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER produce these)

**TEST-001: Happy Path Only**
- NEVER test only the success case. Test: errors, edge cases, boundaries, empty, null.

**TEST-002: Phantom Assertions**
- NEVER write tests without real assertions. `assertTrue(true)` or no assert = no test.

**TEST-003: Implementation Testing**
- NEVER test internal method calls or private state. Test BEHAVIOR: input → output.

**TEST-004: Mock Madness**
- NEVER mock everything. If you're testing the mock, you're testing nothing.
- FIX: Mock external dependencies only (APIs, DBs, file system). Use real internal code.

**TEST-005: The Giant**
- NEVER write one test with 15+ unrelated assertions. One behavior per test case.

**TEST-006: Flaky by Design**
- NEVER depend on timing, execution order, random data, or network in tests.
- FIX: Deterministic data, isolated tests, controlled time, mocked external calls.

**TEST-007: No Cleanup**
- NEVER modify shared state (DB, files, globals) without cleanup/reset between tests.

**TEST-008: Unnamed Tests**
- NEVER write `test('test1')` or `def test_it():`. Names must describe the behavior tested.
- FIX: `test('returns 404 when user not found')`, `def test_rejects_expired_token():`.

**TEST-009: Missing Async Handling**
- NEVER let async tests complete before assertions run.
- FIX: Await promises. Use async test utilities. Verify async errors are caught.

**TEST-010: Snapshot Everything**
- NEVER snapshot every output blindly. Snapshots become stale approval stamps.
- FIX: Snapshot stable structures (API contracts). Assert specific values for logic.

**TEST-011: Excessive Setup**
- NEVER require 10+ mocks before testing starts. Flag the code as too coupled.

**TEST-012: Testing the Framework**
- NEVER verify that React renders or Express routes. The framework already tests that.
- FIX: Test YOUR logic — business rules, data transforms, conditional behavior.

**TEST-013: Silent Catcher**
- NEVER wrap test logic in try-catch that swallows errors.
- FIX: Let assertions throw. Use `expect(...).rejects` for expected errors.

**TEST-014: Hardcoded Environment**
- NEVER hardcode ports, absolute paths, or specific dates in tests.
- FIX: Use dynamic ports, relative/temp paths, and relative time.

**TEST-015: No Error Path Tests**
- NEVER test only success. Every API endpoint needs: 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 tests.

### Quality Rules

**Test Structure (AAA):**
- Arrange: Set up test data and mocks.
- Act: Execute the code under test (single action).
- Assert: Verify the expected outcome.
- Each section clearly identifiable. No mixing.

**Naming Convention:**
- `test_[behavior]_when_[condition]_then_[expected]` or
- `it('should [behavior] when [condition]')`.

**Coverage Strategy:**
- Unit tests: business logic, data transforms, validators.
- Integration tests: cross-module flows, database queries, API endpoints.
- Prefer integration tests for wiring verification over mocked unit tests.

**Mocking Strategy:**
- Mock at boundaries: external APIs, databases, file system, time.
- Never mock the module under test.
- If a test needs >5 mocks, the code needs refactoring, not more mocks.
""".strip()

DEBUGGING_STANDARDS = r"""
## DEBUGGING QUALITY STANDARDS (ALWAYS APPLIED)

AI debuggers default to surface-level fixes. These standards enforce root-cause debugging.

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER commit these debugging failures)

**DEBUG-001: Symptom Fixing**
- NEVER add a null check without understanding WHY the value is null.
- FIX: Trace back to the source. Fix the root cause, not the symptom.

**DEBUG-002: Shotgun Debugging**
- NEVER make random changes hoping something works.
- FIX: Form a hypothesis, test it, proceed based on evidence.

**DEBUG-003: No Reproduction**
- NEVER claim a bug is fixed without first reproducing it.
- FIX: Reproduce reliably first. Verify fix eliminates the reproduction.

**DEBUG-004: Skip the Hypothesis**
- NEVER jump to code changes without analyzing the problem first.
- FIX: Read error message → form hypothesis → validate → then fix.

**DEBUG-005: Console.log Only**
- NEVER rely solely on console.log for debugging.
- FIX: Use debuggers, structured logging, profilers, network inspectors as appropriate.

**DEBUG-006: No Regression Test**
- NEVER fix a bug without adding a test that catches the exact failure.
- FIX: Write a failing test first, then fix the code, then verify test passes.

**DEBUG-007: Ignoring Stack Trace**
- NEVER skip reading the full error message and stack trace.
- FIX: Read every frame. The root cause is often several frames deep.

**DEBUG-008: Confirmation Bias**
- NEVER assume the cause without evidence. "It must be X" without proof is dangerous.
- FIX: Let data drive the diagnosis. Test multiple hypotheses.

**DEBUG-009: Broad Error Suppression**
- NEVER add broader try-catch to "fix" errors. You're hiding bugs.
- FIX: Handle specific errors. Let unexpected ones surface and be investigated.

**DEBUG-010: Collateral Damage**
- NEVER ship a fix that breaks other functionality.
- FIX: Run full test suite after fixing. Check callers of modified code.

### 6-Step Debugging Methodology
1. **Reproduce** — Create reliable reproduction steps. Confirm the bug exists.
2. **Hypothesize** — Based on error message, stack trace, and code reading, form theories.
3. **Validate** — Test hypothesis with targeted investigation (logging, breakpoints, tests).
4. **Fix** — Apply the minimum change that addresses the root cause.
5. **Verify** — Confirm the fix resolves the reproduction. Run related tests.
6. **Prevent** — Add regression test. Document root cause for team knowledge.

E2E_TESTING_STANDARDS = r"""
## E2E TESTING QUALITY STANDARDS (APPLIED DURING E2E PHASE)

E2E tests verify the application works from the user's perspective. These standards
prevent common pitfalls that make E2E tests unreliable or meaningless.

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER produce these)

**E2E-001: Hardcoded Timeouts**
- NEVER use setTimeout, time.sleep, or fixed delays in E2E tests.
- FIX: Use waitFor, waitForResponse, waitForSelector, or page.waitForLoadState.

**E2E-002: Hardcoded Ports/URLs**
- NEVER hardcode localhost:3000 or any specific port in test files.
- FIX: Use configurable base URL via process.env.BASE_URL or test config.

**E2E-003: Mock Data in E2E**
- NEVER use mock data, stubs, or fake responses in E2E tests.
- E2E tests must hit the REAL running server with REAL API calls.
- FIX: Start the actual server, seed test data, make real HTTP calls.

**E2E-004: Empty Test Bodies**
- NEVER write test functions with no assertions. An empty test proves nothing.
- FIX: Every test must assert: status codes, response data, visible elements, or navigation state.

**E2E-005: Test Independence**
- NEVER rely on test execution order. Each test must work in isolation.
- FIX: Clean state per test (fresh user, reset DB, clear storage). Use beforeEach/afterEach.

**E2E-006: Fragile Selectors**
- NEVER use CSS class selectors (.btn-primary) or DOM structure (div > span:nth-child(2)).
- FIX: Use stable selectors: data-testid, getByRole, getByText, getByLabel.

**E2E-007: Happy Path Only**
- NEVER test only the success scenario for each workflow.
- FIX: Include both happy path (valid input → success) and error path (invalid input → error message).

**E2E-008: No Server Lifecycle**
- NEVER assume the server is already running. Tests must manage server startup/shutdown.
- FIX: Use webServer config (Playwright) or beforeAll/afterAll hooks to start/stop server.

**E2E-009: Weak API Assertions**
- NEVER assert only response status (200 OK) without checking the body.
- FIX: Verify response status + body structure + data integrity (correct values, not just shape).

**E2E-010: Missing Visual Verification**
- NEVER skip verifying that UI elements are actually visible after actions.
- FIX: After navigation, verify element visible. After form submit, verify success state.
  Use toBeVisible(), toHaveText(), toHaveURL() assertions.
""".strip()

ARCHITECTURE_QUALITY_STANDARDS = r"""
## ARCHITECTURE QUALITY STANDARDS (ALWAYS APPLIED)

AI architects reproduce tutorial-level architecture. These standards enforce production patterns.

### Quality Rules

**File Structure:**
- Prefer grouping by feature over type: `/features/auth/` not `/controllers/ + /models/ + /services/`.
- Each feature directory contains its routes, services, models, tests.
- Shared code in `/shared/` or `/common/` only when genuinely reused by 3+ features.

**Error Handling Architecture:**
- Define error hierarchy upfront: base app error → domain errors → infrastructure errors.
- Each layer catches its own errors and wraps for the layer above.
- API boundary maps all errors to standard HTTP responses.
- Never let infrastructure errors (DB, network) leak to clients.

**Dependency Flow:**
- Dependencies flow ONE direction: UI → Application → Domain → Infrastructure.
- No circular imports. No infrastructure code importing from UI.
- External services behind interfaces (repository pattern, adapter pattern).
- Dependency injection or factory pattern for testability.

**Scalability:**
- Design for N+1 avoidance from the start. Batch operations where possible.
- Pagination built into every list endpoint. No unbounded queries.
- Caching strategy documented: what to cache, TTL, invalidation.
- Async processing for anything >100ms (email, file processing, external API calls).

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Additive changes only for public APIs (new fields, new endpoints).
- Breaking changes require versioning and migration path.
- Database migrations should be reversible where possible; use multi-step migrations for destructive changes.
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts.

**Shared Utilities:**
- Identify helpers needed by 2+ files at architecture time — place in /lib/ or /utils/.
- Every route/component file that duplicates a helper is an architecture failure.
- Shared module created in first coding wave; consumers import from it.
""".strip()

DATABASE_INTEGRITY_STANDARDS = r"""## DATABASE INTEGRITY QUALITY STANDARDS

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER produce these)

**DB-001: Enum Type Mismatch (ORM vs Raw SQL)**
- NEVER compare an enum column as an integer in raw SQL when the ORM stores it as a string (or vice versa).
- The ORM model type and raw query comparison type MUST match exactly.
- FIX: Use the same type representation in both ORM and raw queries. If ORM uses string enum, raw SQL must compare to strings.

**DB-002: Boolean Type Mismatch (ORM vs Raw SQL)**
- NEVER compare a boolean column as 0/1 in raw SQL when the ORM stores it as true/false (or vice versa).
- FIX: Match the database engine's boolean representation consistently. Use parameterized queries.

**DB-003: DateTime Format Mismatch**
- NEVER hardcode date format strings in raw SQL that differ from the ORM's serialization format.
- FIX: Use parameterized queries for dates. Let the ORM/driver handle serialization.

**DB-004: Missing Default Value**
- NEVER leave boolean or enum properties without an explicit default in entity/model definitions.
- Every boolean MUST have `= false` or `= true`. Every enum MUST have a default member.
- FIX: Add explicit defaults to all boolean and enum properties.

**DB-005: Nullable Property Without Null Check**
- NEVER access a nullable property without a null guard.
- `entity.NullableField.Method()` without `?.` or null check = NullReferenceException.
- FIX: Use null-conditional access (`?.`) or explicit null checks before property access.

**DB-006: FK Without Navigation Property**
- NEVER leave a FK column (`TenderId`, `UserId`) without a corresponding navigation property.
- Without navigation, eager loading (`Include()`) silently returns null.
- FIX: Add navigation property matching the FK name (minus the `Id` suffix).

**DB-007: Navigation Property Without Inverse**
- ALWAYS define the inverse navigation when using navigation properties.
- Without inverse, the ORM cannot properly track changes in both directions.
- FIX: Add `ICollection<Child>` on the parent and parent reference on the child.

**DB-008: FK With No Relationship Configuration**
- NEVER rely on convention-only FK detection for complex relationships.
- Without explicit `.HasMany().WithOne()` or `@relation`, the ORM may not generate correct cascade behavior.
- FIX: Add explicit relationship configuration in entity configuration classes.

### Quality Rules

**Seed Data Completeness:**
- ALL seeded records MUST satisfy the application's standard query filters.
- If the user listing filters on `isActive=true`, seeded users MUST have `isActive=true`.
- Every role defined in the system MUST have at least one seeded account.

**Enum/Status Registry:**
- Every entity with a status/enum field MUST have a complete registry of valid values.
- The DB representation, API representation, and frontend representation MUST be documented.
- State transitions MUST be explicitly defined (which transitions are valid, which are not).

API_CONTRACT_STANDARDS = r"""
## API Contract Verification Standards

### API-001: Backend DTO Field Missing
**Severity:** error
The backend DTO/model class is missing a field that is specified in the SVC-xxx wiring table.
Every field listed in the Response DTO schema must exist as a property in the backend class.
For C# backends, verify PascalCase property names (they serialize to camelCase JSON).

### API-002: Frontend Model Field Mismatch
**Severity:** error
The frontend model/interface uses a different field name than specified in the SVC-xxx wiring table.
Field names must EXACTLY match the contract — no renaming, aliasing, or re-casing.
For TypeScript consuming C# APIs: use the camelCase serialized form, not PascalCase.

### API-003: Type Mismatch
**Severity:** warning
A field's type in the backend or frontend doesn't match the SVC-xxx contract.
Common issues: using `string` for numeric IDs, missing enum mappers, raw Date vs ISO string.

SILENT_DATA_LOSS_STANDARDS = r"""
## Silent Data Loss Prevention Standards

### SDL-001: CQRS Command Handler Missing Persistence
**Severity:** error
A command handler modifies data but never calls SaveChangesAsync() or equivalent.
Data appears saved but is lost. Every command handler that writes data MUST persist.

### ENUM-004: Enum Serialization Format
**Severity:** error
A .NET project does not configure JsonStringEnumConverter globally.
Enums serialize as integers (0, 1, 2) instead of strings ("submitted", "approved"),
causing silent display failures and TypeError crashes in the frontend.
""".strip()


ENDPOINT_XREF_STANDARDS = r"""
## Endpoint Cross-Reference Standards

### XREF-001: Missing Backend Endpoint
Frontend code calls an API endpoint that has no matching backend controller action or route handler.
The endpoint must be created in the backend before the frontend can function correctly.

### XREF-002: HTTP Method Mismatch
Frontend calls an endpoint with a different HTTP method than what the backend defines.
Verify the frontend uses the correct method (GET vs POST vs PUT vs DELETE).

### API-004: Write-Side Field Dropped
Frontend sends a field in a POST/PUT request body that the backend Command/DTO class does not
have as a property. The field is silently ignored. Either add the property to the backend
or remove the field from the frontend form.
""".strip()


CONTRACT_COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS = r"""
## Contract Compliance Verification Standards

### CONTRACT-001: Endpoint Schema Mismatch
**Severity:** error
A controller/route handler returns a response DTO whose fields do not match the contracted
OpenAPI/AsyncAPI schema. Every field defined in the contract spec MUST exist in the response
class with the correct name and compatible type. For TypeScript use interface fields,
for Python use dataclass/Pydantic fields, for C# use public properties.

### CONTRACT-002: Missing Contracted Endpoint
**Severity:** error
A service contract specifies an endpoint (method + path) that has no matching route handler
in the codebase. Every contracted endpoint MUST have a corresponding controller action or
route decorator. Check Flask (@app.route), FastAPI (@router.get/post), Express (router.get/post),
and ASP.NET ([HttpGet]/[HttpPost]) patterns.

### CONTRACT-003: Event Schema Mismatch
**Severity:** warning
An event publisher emits a payload whose fields do not match the contracted AsyncAPI event
schema. Every field in the contract event definition MUST be present in the published payload
object. Check publish/emit/dispatch call sites.

### CONTRACT-004: Shared Model Field Drift
**Severity:** warning
A shared model/DTO used across services has field name discrepancies between its TypeScript,
Python, and/or C# definitions. Fields must match exactly, accounting for language conventions:
camelCase (TypeScript/JSON), snake_case (Python), PascalCase (C# properties).
""".strip()


INTEGRATION_STANDARDS = r"""
## Integration Verification Standards

### INT-001: Cross-Service Contract Coverage
**Severity:** warning
Every service-to-service communication boundary MUST have a corresponding service contract
registered in the contract registry. Uncontracted boundaries are invisible to compliance
scanning and represent integration risk.

### INT-002: Contract Version Synchronization
**Severity:** error
When a service contract is updated, all consuming services MUST be verified against the new
contract version. Stale contract references cause silent integration failures at runtime.

### INT-003: Implementation Evidence
**Severity:** warning
Every implemented contract SHOULD have an evidence_path pointing to the primary implementation
file. Missing evidence makes contract audit trails incomplete and verification unreliable.
""".strip()


SCHEMA_INTEGRITY_STANDARDS = r"""
## Schema Integrity Standards

### SCHEMA-001: Missing Cascade on Parent-Child Relation
**Severity:** error
A parent-child relationship is defined without `onDelete: Cascade` (Prisma), `cascade: true`
(TypeORM), or `ON DELETE CASCADE` (SQL). Deleting a parent will throw FK constraint errors or
leave orphaned child rows. Every child model MUST have cascade behavior defined.

### SCHEMA-002: FK Field Without Relation Annotation
**Severity:** error
A field ending in `_id` exists without a corresponding `@relation` (Prisma), `@ManyToOne`
(TypeORM), or `relationship()` (SQLAlchemy). Without a relation, the ORM cannot enforce
referential integrity, cascade deletes, or provide join/include queries.

### SCHEMA-003: Invalid Default on FK Field
**Severity:** error
A foreign key field uses `@default("")` or an empty string default. Empty strings are not
valid UUIDs/IDs and cause FK constraint violations or broken joins at query time.
Use nullable (`String?`) or remove the default entirely.

### SCHEMA-004: Missing Soft-Delete Middleware
**Severity:** error
Models with `deleted_at` fields exist but no global middleware auto-filters `deleted_at IS NULL`.
Without middleware, every service must manually add the filter — and they WILL forget, causing
deleted records to appear in list views.

### SCHEMA-005: FK Field Missing Index
**Severity:** warning
A foreign key field has a `@relation` but no corresponding `@@index`. Without an index, joins
and filtered queries on FK fields cause full table scans, degrading performance on large tables.

### SCHEMA-006: Inconsistent Financial Decimal Precision
**Severity:** warning
Financial/monetary fields in the same project use different decimal precision formats
(e.g., `Decimal(18,4)` and `Decimal(5,2)`). This causes rounding errors in calculations.
All monetary fields MUST use the same precision tuple.
""".strip()


AUTH_FLOW_STANDARDS = r"""
## Auth Flow Verification Standards

### AUTH-001: MFA Flow Incompatibility
**Severity:** error
The frontend and backend implement different MFA verification flows. Common mismatch:
frontend expects challenge-token flow (login returns `mfaToken`, verify is unauthenticated)
but backend expects inline MFA code during login OR JWT-authenticated verify endpoint.
Both sides MUST implement the SAME flow as documented in the auth contract.

### AUTH-002: Token Storage Mismatch
**Severity:** warning
The frontend stores tokens in a different mechanism than the backend expects to validate.
If the backend sets httpOnly cookies, the frontend should NOT also store in localStorage.
If the frontend uses localStorage, the backend must accept Bearer tokens, not cookies.

### AUTH-003: Login Response Shape Mismatch
**Severity:** error
The frontend expects different fields from the login response than what the backend returns.
Common mismatch: frontend expects `{ accessToken, refreshToken }` but backend returns `{ token }`.
