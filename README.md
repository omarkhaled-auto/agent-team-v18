# Agent Team v15 (Super Team Builder Edition)

Convergence-driven multi-agent orchestration system built on the [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-agent-sdk). Takes any task — from a one-line bug fix to a full PRD — and drives it to verified completion using fleets of specialized AI agents.

> **This is agent-team-v15** — a fork of agent-team extended with MCP client wrappers for integration with the [Super Team](https://github.com/omarkhaled-auto/super-team) multi-service orchestration pipeline. When used as a builder subprocess in the Super Team pipeline, each builder instance receives scoped context (service map, contracts, codebase intelligence) via MCP client APIs.

---

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omarkhaled-auto/Super_Duper_Agent.git
cd Super_Duper_Agent
pip install -e .
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...        # required
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...            # optional, enables web research
```

**5 commands that cover 90% of use cases:**

```bash
agent-team                                           # Interactive — interview first, then build
agent-team "quick fix: button doesn't submit"        # Quick bug fix (auto-detected)
agent-team "thoroughly add JWT auth"                  # Standard feature (auto-detected thorough)
agent-team --prd spec.md                              # Full app from PRD (auto exhaustive)
agent-team "redesign UI" --design-ref https://stripe.com  # Match a reference design
```

**Manage your workspace:**

```bash
agent-team init                                      # Generate a starter config.yaml
agent-team status                                    # Show .agent-team/ contents and run state
agent-team clean                                     # Delete .agent-team/ directory (with confirmation)
agent-team guide                                     # Print built-in usage guide
agent-team --dry-run "add auth"                      # Preview depth, agents, config — no API calls
```

**Cheat sheet — pick a depth:**

| Depth | Trigger | Agents | Use when |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| Quick | `"quick"`, `"fast"`, `"simple"` in task | 1-2 | Typo, one-file fix |
| Standard | (default) | 2-5 | Normal feature, bug |
| Thorough | `"thorough"`, `"refactor"`, `"redesign"`, `"deep"` in task | 3-8 | Multi-file feature, refactor |
| Exhaustive | `--prd`, `"exhaustive"`, `"migrate"`, `"comprehensive"` in task | 5-10 | Full app, major system |

**End the interview** by saying: `"I'm done"`, `"let's go"`, `"start building"`, `"ship it"`, `"lgtm"`, or `"proceed"`. The system will show a summary and ask you to confirm before finalizing.

## How It Works

Agent Team runs a **convergence loop**: agents write code, reviewers try to break it, debuggers fix what's broken, and the loop repeats until every requirement passes adversarial review. Nothing ships half-done.

```
Interview → Codebase Map → Plan → Research → Architect → Contract → Schedule → Code → Review → Debug → Verify → Done
                                                                                 ↑                     ↓
                                                                                 └──── (loop until all pass) ──┘
```

### The Pipeline

| Phase | Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | **Interviewer** | Talks to you through 3 phases (Discovery → Refinement → Ready), writes `.agent-team/INTERVIEW.md` |
| 0.25 | **Constraint Extractor** | Scans your task and interview for prohibitions, requirements, scope limits, technology stack mentions, and test count requirements — injects them into every agent |
| 0.5 | **Codebase Map** | Analyzes project structure, detects languages/frameworks, maps dependencies |
| 0.75 | **Contract Loading** | Loads `CONTRACTS.json` for interface verification (if enabled) |
| 0.9 | **Spec Validator** | Compares original user request against REQUIREMENTS.md — flags missing technologies, features, scope reductions (read-only, always active) |
| 1 | **Planner** | Explores codebase, creates `.agent-team/REQUIREMENTS.md` with checklist. Guardrails enforce: technology preservation, monorepo structure, test requirements |
| 2 | **Researcher** | Queries docs (Context7) and web (Firecrawl), scrapes design references, adds findings to requirements |
| 3 | **Architect** | Designs solution, file ownership map, wiring map, interface contracts |
| 4 | **Task Assigner** | Decomposes requirements into atomic tasks in `.agent-team/TASKS.md` |
| 4.5 | **Smart Scheduler** | Builds dependency DAG, detects file conflicts, computes parallel execution waves |
| 5 | **Code Writer** | Implements assigned tasks (non-overlapping files, reads from TASKS.md). Has 30 frontend + backend anti-patterns injected |
| 6 | **Code Reviewer** | Adversarial review — tries to break everything, marks items pass/fail. Anchored to original user request to catch spec drift. Has 15 review anti-patterns injected |
| 7 | **Debugger** | Fixes specific issues flagged by reviewers. Has 10 debugging anti-patterns + methodology injected |
| 8 | **Test Runner** | Writes and runs tests for each requirement. Has 15 testing anti-patterns injected |
| 9 | **Security Auditor** | OWASP checks, dependency audit, credential scanning |
| 9.5 | **Deep Investigation** | Optional: Gemini CLI + structured 4-phase methodology for cross-file tracing (reviewer, auditor, debugger) |
| 9.6 | **Sequential Thinking** | Structured reasoning at 4 orchestrator decision points + numbered thought methodology for review agents |
| 9.7 | **Quality Spot Checks** | Regex-based scan for anti-patterns (FRONT-xxx, BACK-xxx, SLOP-xxx) in project files |
| 9.8 | **Milestone Health** | PRD mode: tracks per-milestone convergence, detects cross-milestone wiring gaps |
| 9.9 | **Convergence Health** | Post-run health panel: healthy/degraded/failed status, requirements progress, recovery passes |
| 10 | **Progressive Verification** | 5-phase pipeline: requirements compliance → contracts → lint → type check → tests |
| 11 | **Mock Data Scan** | Regex scan for mock data patterns (MOCK-001..007) in service/store/facade files |
| 12 | **UI Compliance Scan** | Regex scan for UI compliance violations (UI-001..004) — hardcoded fonts, arbitrary spacing, missing design tokens |
| 13 | **Deployment Scan** | Cross-references docker-compose.yml with .env files — port mismatches, undefined env vars, CORS origin mismatches |
| 14 | **Asset Scan** | Detects broken static asset references (src, href, url(), require, import) |
| 15 | **PRD Reconciliation** | LLM sub-orchestrator compares REQUIREMENTS.md against built codebase — flags implementation drift |
| 16 | **Database Integrity Scans** | 3 static scans (DB-001..008): dual ORM type consistency, default values, relationship completeness |
| 17 | **API Contract Verification** | Cross-references SVC-xxx field schemas against backend DTO properties and frontend model field names — catches field mismatches before runtime |
| 18 | **E2E Testing Phase** | Real backend API tests + Playwright browser tests — verifies the app actually works end-to-end |
| 19 | **Tracking Documents** | E2E coverage matrix, fix cycle log, milestone handoff docs — structured agent memory between phases |
| 20 | **Browser MCP Testing** | Playwright-based visual browser testing — starts app, executes user workflows, takes screenshots, fixes regressions |

Steps 5-7 repeat in a **convergence loop** until every `- [ ]` in REQUIREMENTS.md becomes `- [x]`.

### Fleet Scaling

Agents deploy in parallel fleets. Fleet size scales with task complexity:

| Depth | Planning | Research | Architecture | Coding | Review | Testing |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Quick | 1-2 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 1 | 1-2 | 1 |
| Standard | 3-5 | 2-3 | 1-2 | 2-3 | 2-3 | 1-2 |
| Thorough | 5-8 | 3-5 | 2-3 | 3-6 | 3-5 | 2-3 |
| Exhaustive | 8-10 | 5-8 | 3-4 | 5-10 | 5-8 | 3-5 |

Depth is auto-detected from keywords in your task ("quick fix" → Quick, "thorough review" → Thorough) or set explicitly with `--depth`.

## Usage Guide

### Task Type A: Quick Bug Fix

**Best for:** One-file fixes, typos, broken imports, CSS tweaks.

```bash
agent-team "quick fix: the submit button on /login calls the wrong API endpoint"
```

What happens:
1. Interview is skipped (task is self-explanatory at this depth)
2. 1-2 planners scan the codebase, write REQUIREMENTS.md
3. 1 code writer fixes the issue
4. 1-2 reviewers verify the fix
5. Done

**Tips:**
- Use `--no-interview` if you already know exactly what's wrong
- Add `--cwd /path/to/project` if you're not in the project directory
- The word "quick" or "fast" in your task auto-selects Quick depth

```bash
# Equivalent explicit version
agent-team --no-interview --depth quick --cwd ./my-app "fix the login button"
```

### Task Type B: Standard Feature

**Best for:** Adding a component, new API endpoint, small integration, single-module work.

```bash
agent-team "add user profile editing with avatar upload to the Express API"
```

What happens:
1. **Interview** — the interviewer asks 3-5 clarifying questions (boundaries, error handling, validation). Answer them, then say `I'm done` or `let's go`
2. **Plan** — planners explore your codebase and create REQUIREMENTS.md
3. **Research** — researchers look up library docs (e.g., multer for file uploads) via Context7
4. **Architecture** — architect designs the solution, creates a wiring map
5. **Task assignment** — decomposes into atomic TASKS.md entries
6. **Convergence loop** — code, review, debug, repeated until all items pass
7. **Testing + security audit**

**Tips:**
- Let the interview run. 2-3 exchanges gives the agents much better context
- Standard depth (default) is right for most features
- If working with an unfamiliar library, Firecrawl + Context7 help a lot — make sure both keys are set

### Task Type C: Thorough Multi-File Feature

**Best for:** Features touching 5-20 files, cross-cutting concerns, refactors, integrations.

```bash
agent-team "thoroughly refactor the authentication system to use JWT with refresh tokens"
```

Or be explicit:

```bash
agent-team --depth thorough "refactor auth to JWT with refresh tokens"
```

What happens:
- Same pipeline as Standard, but with **3-8 agents per phase**
- Multiple code writers work in parallel on non-overlapping files
- Multiple reviewers independently try to break the implementation
- The convergence loop runs more iterations with more thorough reviews

**Tips:**
- The word "thorough", "deep", "detailed", or "carefully" in your task auto-selects this depth
- Use `--agents 15` to override the total agent count if you want more
- Use `-v` (verbose) to see which tools each agent is calling — useful for debugging stalls
- Expect 3+ convergence cycles; the adversarial reviewers are strict

### Task Type D: Full App Build from PRD

**Best for:** Greenfield apps, major systems, 20+ files, anything with a full spec.

There are two paths:

**Path 1: You already have a PRD file**

```bash
agent-team --prd product-spec.md
```

This automatically forces **exhaustive** depth. PRD mode operates in two phases: (1) **Decomposition** — the orchestrator reads the PRD and creates a MASTER_PLAN.md with ordered milestones and dependencies, (2) **Execution** — each milestone is executed in a separate orchestrator session with scoped context (its own REQUIREMENTS.md + compressed summaries of completed predecessors). Enable per-milestone orchestration with `milestone.enabled: true` in config.

**Path 2: Build the PRD through the interview**

```bash
agent-team
```

Just run with no arguments. The interviewer will ask 15-20 deep questions (target users, data model, API design, integrations, deployment). When it detects COMPLEX scope, it writes a full PRD to `.agent-team/INTERVIEW.md` and the orchestrator receives exhaustive depth.

**Tips:**
- For the interview: give detailed answers. The more context you provide, the better the requirements document
- Say "I'm done" only when all your requirements are captured
- If the interview produced scope COMPLEX, the system automatically forces exhaustive depth
- If you have design inspiration: `--design-ref https://stripe.com https://linear.app`
- The Firecrawl key is especially valuable here — researchers will scrape library docs, design references, and competitive examples

### Task Type E: Using Design References

**Best for:** Any frontend/UI task where you want to match an existing design aesthetic.

```bash
# Single reference
agent-team "build a SaaS landing page" --design-ref https://stripe.com

# Multiple references
agent-team --prd spec.md --design-ref https://stripe.com https://linear.app

# Via config.yaml (persistent) — see Configuration section below
```

What the researcher extracts:
- **Colors** — hex values for primary, secondary, accent, backgrounds
- **Typography** — font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- **Spacing** — padding, margin patterns
- **Component patterns** — nav structure, card layouts, button styles, form patterns
- **Screenshots** — cloud-hosted URLs of key pages

All findings go into REQUIREMENTS.md as `DESIGN-xxx` checklist items that code writers implement and reviewers verify. If no URL is provided, this feature is entirely skipped at zero cost.

### Task Type F: Resuming with a Previous Interview

If you ran an interview in a previous session:

```bash
agent-team --interview-doc .agent-team/INTERVIEW.md "build the dashboard"
```

This skips the live interview and feeds the existing document directly to the orchestrator. The scope is detected from the `Scope:` header in the document (SIMPLE/MEDIUM/COMPLEX).

---

## The Interview Phase

The interview is **Phase 0** — it runs before any agents deploy. A good interview saves convergence cycles downstream.

### Three Phases

The interview progresses through structured phases based on exchange count:

| Phase | When | What happens |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Discovery** | First half of min exchanges | Interviewer explores your codebase with tools, asks clarifying questions, shows "My Current Understanding" |
| **Refinement** | Second half of min exchanges | Deepens understanding, proposes approaches, shows "What I Propose" and "Remaining Questions" |
| **Ready** | After min exchanges reached | Can finalize — shows "Final Understanding" and "Proposed Approach" |

The system enforces a minimum number of exchanges (default: 3) before allowing finalization, so the interviewer always explores your codebase before writing the document.

### Starting

```bash
agent-team                                     # Full interactive (no seed)
agent-team "build a task management app"       # With a task seed
agent-team -i "build a task management app"    # Force interactive with seed
```

### During the interview

- **Answer specifically.** "A login page" is worse than "Email + password login, no OAuth, redirect to /dashboard on success, show inline errors on failure."
- **Mention your stack.** "It's a Next.js 14 app with Supabase" gives the interviewer real context to explore.
- **Let it explore your codebase.** If you're in an existing project directory, the interviewer uses Glob/Read/Grep to ask informed questions about your actual code.
- **Don't rush.** 5-10 exchanges for a medium feature, 15-20 for a complex app. The document quality directly affects everything downstream.
- **State constraints clearly.** Say things like "never change the database schema" or "must use the existing auth system" — these get extracted and enforced across all agents (see [Constraint Extraction](#constraint-extraction)).

### Ending the interview

Say any of these phrases (case-insensitive, punctuation ignored):

> `I'm done` · `im done` · `i am done` · `let's go` · `lets go` · `start building` · `start coding` · `proceed` · `build it` · `go ahead` · `that's it` · `thats it` · `that's all` · `thats all` · `begin` · `execute` · `run it` · `ship it` · `do it` · `let's start` · `lets start` · `good to go` · `ready` · `looks good` · `lgtm`

**Negation is handled:** "I'm **not** done" and "don't proceed yet" will NOT end the interview.

**Three-tier exit handling:**

1. **Before minimum exchanges** — the system redirects you back with a summary of understanding gaps and focused questions, so nothing gets finalized too early.
2. **After minimum exchanges** — the system shows a full summary of everything discussed and asks you to confirm ("Does this capture everything? Say **yes** to finalize").
3. **After confirmation** — writes the final INTERVIEW.md document.

### Skipping the interview

```bash
agent-team --no-interview "fix the login bug"               # Skip entirely
agent-team --interview-doc .agent-team/INTERVIEW.md         # Use existing document
```

---

## Constraint Extraction

When you write things like "never change the database schema" or "must use TypeScript" in your task or during the interview, the system automatically picks them up and injects them into every agent's prompt.

### What gets extracted

| Type | Trigger words | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Prohibition** | "never", "don't", "zero", "must not" | "Don't modify the API contract" |
| **Requirement** | "must", "always", "required" | "Must use the existing auth middleware" |
| **Scope limit** | "only", "just the", "limited to" | "Only change files in src/components/" |
| **Technology** | Express.js, React, Next.js, MongoDB, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Docker, etc. (50+ patterns) | "Build with Express.js and MongoDB" → `must use Express.js`, `must use MongoDB` |
| **Test count** | `N+ tests`, `N unit tests` | "Include 20+ tests" → `must have 20+ tests` |

Constraints written in ALL CAPS or with emphasis words like "absolutely" or "critical" get higher priority. The system deduplicates across task text and interview document. Technology names and test counts are auto-extracted from both task text and interview documents.

### How to use

Just write naturally — say "NEVER touch the database migrations" in your task or during the interview, and every agent will see it as a high-priority prohibition.

---

## User Interventions

If you need to redirect the agents mid-run, type a message prefixed with `!!` and press Enter:

```
!! stop changing the CSS, focus on the API endpoints
```

Your message is queued in the background and sent to the orchestrator as a highest-priority follow-up when the current turn finishes. The orchestrator pauses new agent deployments, reads your intervention, adjusts the plan, and resumes. This lets you course-correct without restarting.

> **Windows note:** The terminal may not visually show what you're typing while output is streaming. Type your `!! message` anyway and press Enter — the system reads input in the background.

---

## What It Produces

Agent Team creates a `.agent-team/` directory in your project:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `INTERVIEW.md` | Structured requirements from the interview phase |
| `INTERVIEW_BACKUP.json` | JSON transcript backup of the interview |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Master checklist — the single source of truth |
| `TASKS.md` | Atomic task breakdown with dependency graph |
| `MASTER_PLAN.md` | Milestone plan (PRD mode only — name is configurable) |
| `CONTRACTS.json` | Interface contracts for module exports and wiring |
| `VERIFICATION.md` | Progressive verification summary (health status per task) |
| `STATE.json` | Run state snapshot — saved on interrupt for potential resume |
| `E2E_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md` | Requirement-to-test mapping with checkboxes (E2E phase) |
| `E2E_TEST_PLAN.md` | E2E test plan — what to test, expected behavior |
| `E2E_RESULTS.md` | E2E test results — pass/fail counts, failure details |
| `FIX_CYCLE_LOG.md` | Fix attempt history across all fix loops |
| `MILESTONE_HANDOFF.md` | Interface contracts per milestone for cross-milestone wiring |
| `PRD_RECONCILIATION.md` | PRD vs implementation comparison results |

### Requirements Checklist

Every requirement gets tracked with review cycles:

```markdown
## Requirements Checklist

### Functional Requirements
- [x] REQ-001: User can log in with email and password (review_cycles: 2)
- [ ] REQ-002: Password reset sends email within 30 seconds (review_cycles: 1)

### Technical Requirements
- [x] TECH-001: All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes (review_cycles: 1)

### Wiring Requirements
- [x] WIRE-001: Auth middleware wired to /api routes via Express.use() (review_cycles: 1)

### Design Requirements
- [x] DESIGN-001: Use primary color #635bff for headings and CTAs (review_cycles: 1)

## Review Log
| Cycle | Reviewer | Item | Verdict | Issues Found |
|-------|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | reviewer-1 | REQ-001 | FAIL | Missing input validation on email field |
| 2 | reviewer-2 | REQ-001 | PASS | None |
| 1 | reviewer-1 | REQ-002 | FAIL | Email service not connected |
```

The task is **complete only when every `[ ]` becomes `[x]`**.

---

## Convergence Loop

The core mechanism that ensures quality:

```
1. Code Writers implement from TASKS.md
2. Reviewers adversarially verify against REQUIREMENTS.md
3. If items fail:
   a. Failures < 3 cycles → Debuggers fix specific issues → back to step 1
   b. Failures >= 3 cycles → ESCALATION: re-plan, split requirement, retry
   c. Escalation depth exceeded → asks YOU for guidance
4. If all items pass → Testing Fleet → Security Audit → Done
```

### Convergence Gates

Five hard rules are enforced during the convergence loop to prevent quality shortcuts:

| Gate | Rule |
|------|------|
| **Review authority** | Only code-reviewer and test-runner agents can mark checklist items `[x]`. Coders, debuggers, and architects cannot. |
| **Mandatory re-review** | After every debug fix, a reviewer must verify the fix. Debug → Re-Review is non-negotiable. |
| **Mandatory test wave** | If the user's task or REQUIREMENTS.md mentions tests/testing/test suite/test count, the testing fleet is MANDATORY and BLOCKING — the project cannot be marked complete without tests passing. |
| **Cycle reporting** | After every review cycle, the orchestrator reports "Cycle N: X/Y requirements complete (Z%)". |
| **Depth ≠ thoroughness** | The depth level controls fleet size, not review quality. Even at Quick depth, reviews are thorough. |

### Escalation Protocol

If a requirement fails review 3+ times (configurable):
1. Sent back to Planning + Research fleet for re-analysis
2. Requirement is rewritten or split into sub-tasks
3. Sub-tasks go through the full pipeline
4. Max escalation depth: 2 levels (configurable)
5. If exceeded: the system asks the user for guidance

---

## Design Reference

Provide a reference website URL to have the Researcher agent scrape its design system (colors, typography, spacing, component patterns) and write the findings into REQUIREMENTS.md. Downstream agents then use those design tokens as constraints.

### How to Provide References

References can come from three sources (all are merged and deduplicated):

1. **CLI flag**: `--design-ref https://stripe.com https://linear.app`
2. **config.yaml**: set `design_reference.urls`
3. **Interview**: the interviewer asks about design inspiration for frontend tasks

### What Gets Extracted

The Researcher uses Firecrawl to scrape reference sites at three depth levels:

| Depth | What's Extracted |
|-------|-----------------|
| `branding` | Color palette, typography, spacing, component styles |
| `screenshots` | Branding + cloud-hosted screenshot URLs for each page |
| `full` (default) | Branding + screenshots + component pattern analysis (nav, cards, forms, footer) |

### Data Flow

```
config.yaml urls + --design-ref CLI + interview URLs
    → deduplicated in CLI
    → injected into orchestrator prompt
    → orchestrator assigns researcher(s) to design analysis
    → researcher scrapes via Firecrawl (branding, screenshots, components)
    → writes to REQUIREMENTS.md ## Design Reference
    → architect defines design tokens from extracted data
    → code writer applies colors, fonts, component patterns
    → reviewer verifies DESIGN-xxx items like any other requirement
```

---

## Configuration

Create `config.yaml` in your project root or `~/.agent-team/config.yaml`, or run `agent-team init` to generate a starter config.

```yaml

  max_turns: 500          # Max agentic turns per session
  max_budget_usd: null    # Cost cap — warns at 80%, stops at 100% (null = unlimited)
  max_thinking_tokens: null  # Extended thinking budget (null = disabled, >= 1024 to enable)
  permission_mode: "acceptEdits"

depth:
  default: "standard"     # Default depth when no keywords detected
  auto_detect: true       # Detect depth from task keywords
  scan_scope_mode: "auto" # "auto" (depth-based), "full" (always full), "changed" (always scoped)
  keyword_map:

### Config Recipes

**Cost-conscious (small tasks):**
```yaml
orchestrator:
  max_budget_usd: 5.0     # Hard cap at $5
depth:
  default: "quick"
convergence:
  max_cycles: 3
agents:
  security_auditor:
    enabled: false
```

**Maximum quality (production features):**
```yaml
depth:
  default: "thorough"
convergence:
  max_cycles: 15
  escalation_threshold: 2
interview:
  max_exchanges: 100
  min_exchanges: 5         # Force deeper exploration
verification:
  blocking: true           # Failures are hard stops
```

**Non-blocking verification (move fast, fix later):**
```yaml
verification:
  blocking: false          # Failures become warnings instead of hard stops
```

**Mixed models (save cost on sub-agents):**
```yaml
orchestrator:
  model: "opus"
agents:
  planner:
    model: "sonnet"
  researcher:
    model: "sonnet"
  code_writer:
    model: "opus"       # keep opus for coding
  code_reviewer:
    model: "opus"       # keep opus for adversarial review
  test_runner:
    model: "sonnet"
  security_auditor:
    model: "sonnet"
  debugger:
    model: "opus"
```

**Deep investigation (Gemini CLI cross-file tracing):**
```yaml
investigation:
  enabled: true               # Requires Gemini CLI installed
  gemini_model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
  max_queries_per_agent: 8    # Budget per agent (self-regulated)
```

**Backend-only (no design scraping):**
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  firecrawl:
    enabled: false
design_reference:
  urls: []
```

## CLI Reference

```
agent-team [TASK] [OPTIONS]
agent-team <subcommand>

Positional:
  TASK                    Task description (omit for interactive mode)

### Subcommands

Run these without a task:

```bash
agent-team init       # Creates config.yaml with documented defaults
agent-team status     # Lists files in .agent-team/, shows run ID and phase if STATE.json exists
agent-team clean      # Deletes .agent-team/ — asks "Delete .agent-team/ directory? [y/N]" first
agent-team guide      # Prints a quick reference of all commands and flags
```

### Common patterns

```bash
# ---- Modes ----
agent-team                                    # Interactive (interview → orchestrate)
agent-team "task"                             # Single-shot (auto-detect depth)
agent-team -i "task"                          # Force interactive with seed
agent-team --prd spec.md                      # PRD mode (exhaustive)
agent-team --dry-run "task"                   # Preview what would happen (no API calls)

# ---- Depth control ----
agent-team --depth quick "task"               # Explicit quick
agent-team "quick fix for the typo"           # Auto-detected quick
agent-team "refactor the auth module"         # Auto-detected thorough (refactor keyword)
agent-team "migrate to PostgreSQL"            # Auto-detected exhaustive (migrate keyword)
agent-team --depth exhaustive "task"          # Explicit exhaustive

# ---- Agent control ----
agent-team --agents 20 "task"                 # Override total agents
agent-team "use 10 agents for this"           # Detected from task text
agent-team "deploy 5 agents to fix auth"      # Also detected

# ---- Interview control ----
agent-team --no-interview "task"              # Skip interview
agent-team --interview-doc doc.md "task"      # Use existing document

# ---- Design references ----
agent-team --design-ref https://stripe.com                      # Single
agent-team --design-ref https://stripe.com https://linear.app   # Multiple

# ---- Project control ----
agent-team --cwd /path/to/project "task"      # Set working directory
agent-team --config custom.yaml "task"        # Custom config file

# ---- Workspace management ----
agent-team init                               # Generate starter config.yaml
agent-team status                             # Check .agent-team/ state
agent-team clean                              # Delete .agent-team/ directory

# ---- Output control ----
agent-team -v "task"                          # Verbose (show tool calls)
```

## Practical Workflow Examples

### Fix a bug in an existing project

```bash
cd my-project
agent-team --no-interview "quick fix: the /api/users endpoint returns 500 when email contains a plus sign"
```

### Add a feature with interview

```bash
cd my-project
agent-team "add Stripe subscription billing to the Express backend"
# Interview: 5-8 exchanges about plans, webhooks, trial periods
# Say: "I'm done"
# Agents build it
```

### Build a full app from scratch

```bash
mkdir new-saas && cd new-saas
agent-team
# Interview: 15-20 exchanges building a full PRD
# Interviewer detects COMPLEX scope → exhaustive depth
# Say: "let's go"
# Full pipeline: plan → research → architect → code → review → debug → test
```

### Redesign UI to match a reference

```bash
cd my-frontend
agent-team "redesign the dashboard to look like Linear" \
  --design-ref https://linear.app \
  --depth thorough
```

### Run from a PRD you wrote

```bash
agent-team --prd docs/product-spec.md --design-ref https://stripe.com
# Exhaustive depth auto-activated
# MASTER_PLAN.md created with milestones
# Each milestone goes through the full convergence loop
```

### Cost-effective quick iterations

```bash
# First pass: quick depth, no interview
agent-team --no-interview --depth quick "add a logout button to the navbar"

# Review what it built, then refine with more depth
agent-team --no-interview --depth standard "fix the logout button: it should clear localStorage and redirect to /login"
```

## Depth Levels — Deep Dive

Depth is the single most important parameter. It controls how many agents deploy and how thorough the process is.

### How depth is determined (precedence order)

1. **`--depth` flag** — explicit, always wins
2. **`--prd` flag** — forces exhaustive automatically
3. **Interview scope COMPLEX** — forces exhaustive automatically
4. **Auto-detected from keywords** — keywords in your task text
5. **Config default** — `standard` unless changed in config.yaml

### Auto-detection keywords

| Keyword in your task | Maps to |
|---------------------|---------|
| `quick`, `fast`, `simple` | Quick |
| `thorough`, `carefully`, `deep`, `detailed`, `refactor`, `redesign`, `restyle`, `rearchitect`, `overhaul`, `rewrite`, `restructure`, `revamp`, `modernize` | Thorough |
| `exhaustive`, `comprehensive`, `complete`, `migrate`, `migration`, `replatform`, `entire`, `every`, `whole` | Exhaustive |

When multiple keywords appear, the **most intensive** depth wins. "Quick but comprehensive" resolves to **Exhaustive**.

Word-boundary matching prevents false positives — "adjustment" does NOT match "just".

The system now shows you exactly which keywords were matched and why a depth was chosen (visible in terminal output).

### What each depth level does

| | Quick | Standard | Thorough | Exhaustive |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Interview** | Skipped or 2-3 Q's | 3-5 questions | 5-10 questions | 15-20 questions |
| **Planners** | 1-2 | 3-5 | 5-8 | 8-10 |
| **Researchers** | 0-1 | 2-3 | 3-5 | 5-8 |
| **Code writers** | 1 | 2-3 | 3-6 | 5-10 |
| **Reviewers** | 1-2 | 2-3 | 3-5 | 5-8 |
| **Convergence cycles** | 1-2 typical | 2-4 typical | 3-6 typical | 5-10 typical |
| **Cost** | $ | $$ | $$$ | $$$$ |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `Error: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set` | `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...` or add to `.env` |
| `Configuration error: ...` | Check your config.yaml — the system now shows clean error messages for invalid configs (e.g., `min_exchanges > max_exchanges`) |
| `[warn] FIRECRAWL_API_KEY not set` | Set it or disable firecrawl in config. Web research still works via Context7 |
| Interview won't let me finish | You haven't reached the minimum exchange count (default: 3). Answer a few more questions, then say "I'm done" |
| Interview exits too early | Shouldn't happen anymore — the system now asks for confirmation before finalizing. If it still does, check `min_exchanges` in config |
| Convergence loop stuck | Check `.agent-team/REQUIREMENTS.md` Review Log for what keeps failing. Consider reducing `escalation_threshold` |
| Too expensive | Set `max_budget_usd` in config, use `--depth quick`, disable unused agents, or use `sonnet` model for sub-agents |
| Want to preview before spending tokens | Use `--dry-run` to see depth, agents, and config without making any API calls |
| Need to redirect agents mid-run | Type `!! your message` in the terminal to send a priority intervention |
| Interrupted mid-run | State is auto-saved on Ctrl+C. Run `agent-team status` to see saved state |
| `agent-team` command not found | Run `pip install -e .` again, or use `python -m agent_team` instead |
| Wrong project directory | Use `--cwd /absolute/path/to/project` |
| npm/npx not found on Windows | Fixed: verification now resolves `.cmd` suffixes automatically via `shutil.which()` |
| REQUIREMENTS.md doesn't match task | spec-validator agent (always active) compares requirements against your original request and flags discrepancies |

## Testing

The test suite covers every module with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run unit + integration tests (no API keys needed)
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Run E2E tests (requires real API keys in environment)
pytest tests/ -v --run-e2e

# Count collected tests
pytest tests/ --co -q

### Live E2E Verification

The system has been verified with live end-to-end convergence tests that confirm all orchestration features work against the real Claude API.

**13/13 verification checks passed (100%)** across 9 issues:

| Issue | Fix Validated | Evidence |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Convergence cycles | Yes | Cycle tracking shown, 37/37 requirements at 100% |
| Requirements marking | Yes | All `- [x]` properly checked |
| Task completion | Yes | All 4 tasks marked COMPLETE |
| Contract generation | Yes | CONTRACTS.json with 4 contracts |
| Health display | Yes | `CONVERGENCE HEALTH: HEALTHY` banner |
| Schedule waves | Yes | Phase/schedule references in output |
| Recovery logging | Yes | Health info displayed |
| Cycle counter | Yes | `Convergence cycles: 0` tracked |
| Diagnostic post-orch | Yes | No blind mark-all, proper diagnostic marking |

**Convergence loop stress test:** A run-length encoding test with deliberately tricky edge cases (digits as input, multi-digit counts, roundtrip identity) confirmed the agent's ability to detect test failures and iterate on fixes within a single run — the agent went through 3 implementation attempts before all 13 tests passed.

### Known Bug Verification

The test suite explicitly verifies fixes for known bugs:

| Bug | Test | Verified Behavior |
|-----|------|-------------------|
| C1: Empty stdin loop | `test_is_interview_exit` — empty string | Returns `False`, doesn't loop |
| C2: PRD depth override | `test_prd_forces_exhaustive` | `--prd` forces exhaustive depth |
| #3: Malformed YAML | `test_load_config_malformed_yaml_raises` | Raises `yaml.YAMLError` |
| I6: Scope from --interview-doc | `test_interview_doc_scope_detected` | `_detect_scope()` called on doc |
| #7: Empty research tools | `test_empty_servers_returns_empty_list` | Returns `[]` not `None` |
| I7: Substring false match | `test_word_boundary_no_substring` | "adjustment" does not match "just" |
| I11: Bold scope format | `test_markdown_bold` | `**Scope:** COMPLEX` parses correctly |
| #9: Falsy config override | `TestDesignReferenceFalsyValues` | `urls: []` stays `[]`, not overridden by default |
| #4: Hardcoded agent model | `TestPerAgentModelConfig` | Config model propagates to agent definitions |
| #10: CLI flag collision | `TestMutualExclusion` | `--progressive`/`--no-progressive` are mutually exclusive |
| #17: Name duality | `TestAgentNamingConsistency` | Underscore config keys map to hyphenated SDK names |
| #20: Template injection | `TestTemplateSubstitution` | `safe_substitute` handles missing vars gracefully |
| Tier 3a: Off-by-one exit | `TestInterviewPhases` | Exit at exactly `min_exchanges` triggers confirmation, not redirect |
| DepthDetection recursion | `TestDepthDetection` | `__getattr__` doesn't loop during `copy.deepcopy` or `pickle` |
| Trust gap: spec drift | `TestSpecValidatorPrompt` | spec-validator always active, read-only, catches missing tech/features |
| Trust gap: reviewer not anchored | `TestReviewerAnchoring` | CODE_REVIEWER_PROMPT references ORIGINAL USER REQUEST |
| Trust gap: planner simplifies | `TestPlannerGuardrails` | PLANNER_PROMPT preserves technologies, monorepo, test counts |
| Trust gap: tests skipped | `TestMandatoryTestWave` | ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT has MANDATORY TEST RULE |
| Trust gap: missing deps | `TestCheckRequirementsCompliance` | Phase 0 checks tech in package.json/pyproject.toml |
| Windows PATH failure | `TestResolveCommand` | `_resolve_command` tries .cmd suffix on Windows |
| Constraint: tech not extracted | `TestEnhancedConstraintExtraction` | Technology mentions auto-extracted as constraints |
| O(n²) cost counting | `TestCostAccumulation` | Each `ResultMessage.total_cost_usd` counted exactly once |
| Config validation crash | `TestDictToConfig` | `min_exchanges > max_exchanges` raises clean `ValueError` |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Requirements as source of truth**: Every agent reads from and writes to `.agent-team/REQUIREMENTS.md`. No implicit state.
- **Adversarial review**: Reviewers are prompted to _break_ things, not confirm they work. Items are rejected more than accepted on first pass.
- **Task atomicity**: TASKS.md decomposes work into tasks targeting 1-3 files max, with explicit dependency DAGs. Code writers get non-overlapping file assignments.
- **Wiring verification**: Architects produce a Wiring Map (WIRE-xxx entries) documenting every cross-file connection. Reviewers trace each connection from entry point to feature, flagging orphaned code.
- **Contract verification**: Interface contracts (`CONTRACTS.json`) declare which symbols each module must export and how modules import from each other. Verification is deterministic and runs without LLM involvement.
- **Progressive verification**: A 5-phase pipeline (requirements compliance → contracts → lint → type check → tests) validates each completed task. Phase 0 is deterministic — it checks declared technologies against `package.json`/`pyproject.toml` dependencies, validates monorepo structure, and verifies test files exist when testing is mentioned. Health is tracked as green/yellow/red across the project.
- **Constraint propagation**: User constraints ("never", "must", "only") are extracted from task text and interview, then injected into every agent's system prompt with emphasis levels. Technology mentions (Express.js, React, MongoDB, etc.) and test count requirements ("20+ tests") are also auto-extracted as constraints.
- **Spec fidelity validation**: A dedicated spec-validator agent (read-only, always active) compares the original user request against REQUIREMENTS.md to catch scope reductions, missing technologies, and missing features before code is written.
- **Original request anchoring**: The reviewer is anchored to the original user request — not just REQUIREMENTS.md — so spec drift (where the planner simplifies the user's intent) is caught at review time.
- **Planner guardrails**: The planner is explicitly instructed to preserve user-specified technologies, monorepo/full-stack structure, and test requirements. These guardrails prevent the most common cause of the "trust gap" (planner simplifying what the user asked for).
- **Mandatory test wave**: When the user's task or REQUIREMENTS.md mentions tests, the testing fleet is mandatory and blocking — the project cannot be marked complete without tests passing.
- **Code quality standards**: 70 anti-patterns across 5 domains (Frontend, Backend, Code Review, Testing, Debugging) plus Architecture quality rules are automatically injected into relevant agent prompts. Non-configurable — always on, zero setup. Each agent receives only its domain-specific standards (e.g., code-writer gets Frontend + Backend, test-runner gets Testing).
- **Convergence gates**: Only code-reviewer and test-runner agents can mark items `[x]`. Debug fixes require mandatory re-review. These rules are embedded in each agent's prompt.
- **Smart scheduling**: Tasks are parsed into a DAG, file conflicts are detected and resolved via configurable strategies, execution waves are capped by `max_parallel_tasks`, and critical path analysis identifies bottleneck tasks.
- **Type-safe enums**: Categorical config values (`depth`, `conflict_strategy`, `severity`, etc.) use `str, Enum` classes for both type safety and JSON/YAML serialization compatibility.
- **State persistence**: Run state (task, depth, phase, cost) is saved to `STATE.json` on interrupt via atomic file writes (`tempfile` + `os.replace`), preventing corruption if the process dies mid-write.
- **Template safety**: Orchestrator prompt variables use `string.Template.safe_substitute()` — unmatched `$vars` are left intact instead of crashing.
- **Subprocess security**: All external commands (`lint`, `type check`, `test`) use `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` (not `shell`), preventing shell injection. Command lists are constructed from hardcoded strings only. On Windows, commands are resolved to full paths via `shutil.which()` with `.cmd` suffix fallback to handle npm/npx PATH issues.
- **Path traversal protection**: Import path resolution in codebase mapping validates resolved paths stay within the project root.
- **Transcript backup**: Interview exchanges are saved to `INTERVIEW_BACKUP.json` independently of Claude's file writes, so context is never lost.
- **Word-boundary matching**: Depth detection and scope detection use `\b` regex boundaries to prevent false positives ("adjustment" won't match "just").
- **Deep investigation protocol**: An optional 4-phase structured methodology (SCOPE → INVESTIGATE → SYNTHESIZE → EVIDENCE) injected into review agents (code-reviewer, security-auditor, debugger). When Gemini CLI is installed, agents can use it for cross-file tracing with a per-agent query budget. Degrades gracefully: disabled by default (zero impact), enabled without Gemini (methodology only, still valuable), enabled with Gemini (full cross-file analysis).
- **Sequential Thinking**: Two layers of structured reasoning. (1) Review agents get a numbered thought methodology (hypothesis → verify → revise) that composes with the investigation protocol. (2) The orchestrator uses Sequential Thinking at 4 decision points: pre-run strategy, architecture checkpoint, convergence reasoning, and completion verification. All 4 points fire at every depth level — depth controls fleet scale, not reasoning quality. Each point has a configurable thought budget. The Sequential Thinking MCP server is enabled by default.
- **Quality optimization**: Three production-quality features enabled by default. `production_defaults` injects production-readiness requirements (TECH-xxx) into the planner. `craft_review` adds a CODE CRAFT pass to reviewers (naming, structure, duplication). `quality_triggers_reloop` feeds quality violations back into the convergence loop so they get fixed, not just reported.
- **Anti-pattern spot checks**: `quality_checks.py` scans project files with compiled regex patterns for common anti-patterns (FRONT-xxx, BACK-xxx, SLOP-xxx). Runs as a non-blocking advisory phase in the verification pipeline. Capped at 100 violations per scan.
- **Zero mock data policy**: Code writers are explicitly prohibited from using mock data (RxJS of(), Promise.resolve(), BehaviorSubject, hardcoded variables). Seven regex patterns (MOCK-001..007) scan service/store/facade files. Covers Angular, React, Vue/Nuxt, and Python.
- **E2E testing phase**: After convergence-driven reviews pass, real HTTP calls to real APIs (backend) and real Playwright browser interactions (frontend) verify the app actually works. Fix loops diagnose failure types and apply targeted strategies (implement feature, fix auth, fix wiring, fix logic).
- **Browser MCP visual testing**: After E2E tests pass, a Playwright MCP agent launches the app in a real browser, executes user-facing workflows (login, CRUD, navigation), takes screenshots, and verifies visual correctness. Regression sweeps re-run all passed workflows after each fix. Triple-gated (config + depth + E2E pass rate). Crash-isolated with finally-block app cleanup.
- **Tracking documents**: Three per-phase documents (coverage matrix, fix cycle log, milestone handoff) give agents structured memory between phases, preventing superficial testing, repeated fix strategies, and zero cross-milestone wiring.
- **API contract verification**: Three-layer system catches DTO field name mismatches between backend and frontend. Prevention: architect prompt forces exact field schemas in SVC-xxx table. Detection: `run_api_contract_scan()` cross-references code against contract. Guarantee: fix loop runs sub-orchestrator to correct mismatches. PascalCase-aware (C# properties serialize to camelCase). Only fires for full-stack apps.
- **Database integrity scans**: Three static scans catch dual ORM type mismatches, missing default values, and incomplete relationship configuration across C#, TypeScript, and Python frameworks. Prompt policies (seed data completeness, enum/status registry) prevent these bugs at code-writing time.
- **Depth-gated post-orchestration**: The entire post-orchestration pipeline is depth-aware. Quick fixes skip all scans. Standard scopes to changed files. Thorough/exhaustive auto-enable E2E testing. User overrides are sacred — explicit config values survive depth gating.
- **Scoped scanning**: `compute_changed_files()` uses git diff to determine what changed. Seven scan functions accept an optional scope parameter. Cross-file/aggregate checks use full file lists even when scoped, ensuring semantic correctness.
- **Milestone management**: PRD mode now uses two-phase orchestration. Phase 1 (Decomposition): the orchestrator reads the PRD and creates MASTER_PLAN.md with ordered milestones and dependencies. Phase 2 (Execution): each milestone runs in a separate orchestrator session with scoped context — its own REQUIREMENTS.md plus compressed summaries of completed predecessors. `milestone_manager.py` handles MASTER_PLAN.md parsing, milestone context building, completion caching, rollup health computation, and cross-milestone wiring gap detection. Controlled via the `milestone` config section (disabled by default).
- **Convergence health display**: After each orchestration run, a convergence health panel shows status (healthy/degraded/failed), a visual requirements progress bar, review cycle count, and recovery pass information. Three configurable thresholds (`min_convergence_ratio`, `recovery_threshold`, `degraded_threshold`) drive the health classification.
- **Non-interactive interviewer**: When stdin is not a TTY (CI/CD pipelines, scripted runs), the interviewer automatically skips the interactive Q&A loop. Scope estimation falls back to heuristic analysis of the spec text when no `Scope:` header is found in the interview document.
- **Wiring dependency scheduling**: `wiring.py` identifies WIRE-xxx tasks in TASKS.md and builds a dependency map so the scheduler defers integration tasks until all prerequisite implementation tasks are complete.
- **Convergence health tracking**: Three configurable thresholds (`min_convergence_ratio`, `recovery_threshold`, `degraded_threshold`) give the orchestrator visibility into whether convergence is healthy, recovering, or degraded, enabling smarter escalation decisions.
- **Pipe-safe output**: Rich console uses `force_terminal=sys.stdout.isatty()` to prevent ANSI escape sequences from garbling piped output.

## Security

The following security properties are maintained:

| Area | Protection |
|------|-----------|
| Subprocess execution | `create_subprocess_exec` only — no shell interpretation |
| YAML deserialization | `yaml.safe_load` — no arbitrary object instantiation |
| Template variables | `string.Template.safe_substitute` — no crash on missing vars |
| File path resolution | `Path.resolve()` + `startswith()` bounds checking |
| API key handling | Keys read from environment only, never logged or included in prompts |
| Command resolution | `shutil.which()` resolves commands to full paths; `.cmd` fallback on Windows for npm/npx |
| Signal handling | Thread-safe under CPython GIL, first Ctrl+C warns, second saves state and exits |
| State file writes | Atomic via `tempfile.mkstemp` + `os.replace` — no corruption on crash |

---

## Post-Orchestration Pipeline (v2.0-v12.3)

After the convergence loop completes, a 15-step post-orchestration pipeline runs quality scans, integrity checks, E2E verification, and browser testing. All steps are depth-gated, crash-isolated, and independently configurable.

```
Scope Computation → Mock Data Scan → UI Compliance Scan → Deployment Scan
→ Asset Scan → PRD Reconciliation → DB Dual ORM Scan → DB Default Value Scan
→ DB Relationship Scan → API Contract Verification → Silent Data Loss Scan
→ Endpoint XREF Scan → E2E Backend Tests → E2E Frontend Tests
→ Browser MCP Testing → Recovery Report
```

### Depth Gating

| Scan/Feature | Quick | Standard | Thorough | Exhaustive |
|-------------|-------|----------|----------|------------|
| Mock data scan | SKIP | SCOPED | FULL | FULL |
| UI compliance scan | SKIP | SCOPED | FULL | FULL |
| Deployment scan | SKIP | FULL | FULL | FULL |
| Asset scan | SKIP | SCOPED | FULL | FULL |
| PRD reconciliation | SKIP | SKIP | CONDITIONAL | FULL |
| DB scans (3) | SKIP | SCOPED | FULL | FULL |
| API contract scan | SKIP | FULL | FULL | FULL |
| Silent data loss scan | SKIP | FULL | FULL | FULL |
| Endpoint XREF scan | SKIP | FULL | FULL | FULL |
| E2E testing | SKIP | OPT-IN | AUTO-ENABLED | AUTO-ENABLED |
| Browser MCP testing | SKIP | SKIP | AUTO-ENABLED (PRD) | AUTO-ENABLED (PRD) |

**SCOPED** = only files changed since last commit are scanned (via `git diff`).
**CONDITIONAL** = PRD recon only runs if REQUIREMENTS.md >500 bytes + contains REQ-xxx.
**AUTO-ENABLED** = E2E testing turns on automatically (unless user set `enabled: false`).
**AUTO-ENABLED (PRD)** = Browser testing turns on at thorough/exhaustive depth when PRD mode is active.

### Quality Scan Patterns

| Category | Patterns | What They Catch |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Mock Data | MOCK-001..007 | RxJS of(), Promise.resolve(), BehaviorSubject, fake variables in services |
| UI Compliance | UI-001..004 | Hardcoded fonts, arbitrary spacing, missing design tokens, config file violations |
| E2E Quality | E2E-001..007 | Hardcoded timeouts, localhost ports, mock data in tests, empty bodies, placeholder text |
| Deployment | DEPLOY-001..004 | Port mismatches, undefined env vars, CORS origin, service name mismatches |
| Asset | ASSET-001..003 | Broken image/font/media, CSS url(), require/import references |
| Database | DB-001..008 | Dual ORM type mismatch, missing defaults, nullable access, FK/nav gaps |
| API Contract | API-001..004 | Backend DTO missing field, frontend model field mismatch, type incompatibility, write-side field passthrough |
| Silent Data Loss | SDL-001 | CQRS command handler doesn't persist all fields to database |
| Endpoint XREF | XREF-001..002 | Frontend calls missing backend endpoint, HTTP method mismatch |

### Endpoint Cross-Reference (v12.0)

Auto-detects backend framework (.NET, Express, Flask/FastAPI/Django) and cross-references every frontend HTTP call against backend route definitions.

1. **Extract frontend calls** — Angular HttpClient, Axios, raw `fetch()`, variable-URL resolution
2. **Extract backend routes** — ASP.NET `[HttpGet]`, Express `router.get()`, Python decorators, mount prefix resolution
3. **3-level matching** — Exact (path+method) → method-agnostic (XREF-002 warning) → no match (XREF-001 error)
4. **Function-call URL filter** — URLs like `${this.func(...)}/path` demoted to `info` severity (unresolvable statically)
5. **Fix loop** — Sub-orchestrator creates missing backend endpoints; severity filter skips info-only violations

### API Contract Verification

When enabled (default, disabled at quick depth), the API contract scan:

1. **Parse SVC-xxx table** from REQUIREMENTS.md — extracts field schemas like `{ id: number, title: string }`
2. **Cross-reference backend** — Checks DTO/model classes for every field (PascalCase and camelCase)
3. **Cross-reference frontend** — Checks model/interface files for exact field name matches
4. **Fix loop** — Sub-orchestrator corrects field mismatches (adds properties, renames fields)

**Full-stack gate:** Only runs when `detect_app_type()` reports both `has_backend` and `has_frontend`.
**Backward compatible:** Legacy SVC-xxx rows with class names only (no field schemas) produce zero violations.

### E2E Testing Phase

When enabled (opt-in at standard, auto-enabled at thorough/exhaustive), the E2E phase:

1. **Backend API E2E** — Writes real HTTP test scripts, executes against running server, fixes APP on failure
2. **Frontend Playwright E2E** — Navigates every route, tests every workflow, verifies forms submit and persist
3. **70% Backend Gate** — Frontend tests only run if backend achieves >=70% pass rate
4. **Fix Loop** — Up to `max_fix_retries` fix-rerun cycles per part (fixes the app, not the test)
5. **Tracking** — E2E coverage matrix maps every requirement to a test; fix cycle log prevents repeated strategies

### Browser MCP Testing Phase

When enabled (auto-enabled at thorough/exhaustive + PRD mode), the Browser MCP phase:

1. **App Startup** — Starts the built application, verifies health endpoint responds
2. **Workflow Generation** — Creates user-facing workflows from REQUIREMENTS.md (login, CRUD, navigation)
3. **Workflow Execution** — Playwright MCP clicks through each workflow, takes screenshots at each step
4. **Fix Loop** — Up to `max_fix_retries` fix-rerun cycles per failing workflow (fixes the app, not the test)
5. **Regression Sweep** — After each fix, ALL previously passed workflows are re-tested
6. **Readiness Report** — Final summary with pass/fail counts, screenshot inventory, unresolved issues

**Triple gate:** `browser_testing.enabled` + depth gating (thorough/exhaustive + PRD) + `e2e_pass_rate_gate` (70% E2E pass rate).

### Tracking Documents

Three documents give agents structured memory between phases:

| Document | Phase | Prevents |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `E2E_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md` | E2E Testing | Superficial testing (5 happy paths for 30+ workflows) |
| `FIX_CYCLE_LOG.md` | All Fix Loops | Blind fix loops (same fix 3 times with no memory) |
| `MILESTONE_HANDOFF.md` | PRD+ Milestones | Zero cross-milestone wiring (75 mock methods) |

## Differences from Base agent-team

This repository (`agent-team-v15`) extends the base `agent-team` (also known as `claude-agent-team`) with the following additions:

| Feature | Base agent-team | agent-team-v15 |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **MCP Client Wrappers** | Not included | `ContractClient`, `CodebaseClient` for Super Team integration |
| **Builder Subprocess Mode** | Not supported | Can be spawned by Super Orchestrator with scoped context |
| **Service-Scoped Context** | Full project only | Receives per-service context (service map, contracts, codebase intelligence) |
| **Contract Registration** | Local CONTRACTS.json only | Registers contracts with the Contract Engine MCP service |
| **Cross-Service Awareness** | Single-service focus | Reads sibling service contracts to ensure API compatibility |

All base agent-team features (interview, convergence loop, quality scans, milestone management, etc.) remain fully functional. The MCP client wrappers are additive and do not modify the core orchestration logic.

---

## MCP Client API Reference

### ContractClient

Wraps the Contract Engine MCP service (port 8002) for contract lifecycle management.

```python
from agent_team.mcp_clients import ContractClient

# Initialize with service URL
client = ContractClient(base_url="http://localhost:8002")

# Register a new contract
contract = client.create_contract(
    service_name="user-service",
    contract_type="openapi",
    version="1.0.0",
    spec={
        "openapi": "3.1.0",
        "info": {"title": "User Service", "version": "1.0.0"},
        "paths": {
            "/api/users": {
                "get": {"summary": "List users", "responses": {"200": {}}}
            }
        }
    }
)

# List all contracts for a service
contracts = client.list_contracts(service_name="user-service")

# Validate a contract spec
result = client.validate_contract(contract_id=contract["id"])

# Check for breaking changes between versions
changes = client.detect_breaking_changes(
    service_name="user-service",
    old_version="1.0.0",
    new_version="2.0.0"
)

# Mark a contract endpoint as implemented
client.mark_implementation(
    contract_id=contract["id"],
    endpoint="/api/users",
    method="GET"
)

# Get unimplemented endpoints
unimplemented = client.get_unimplemented(contract_id=contract["id"])
```

### CodebaseClient

Wraps the Codebase Intelligence MCP service (port 8003) for code analysis and semantic search.

```python
from agent_team.mcp_clients import CodebaseClient

# Initialize with service URL
client = CodebaseClient(base_url="http://localhost:8003")

# Index a file for analysis
client.index_file(file_path="/src/services/user.py", language="python")

# Semantic code search
results = client.search_code(
    query="authentication middleware",
    language="python",
    top_k=5
)

# Get symbols (functions, classes, variables) from a file
symbols = client.get_symbols(file_path="/src/services/user.py")

# Get dependency graph for a file
deps = client.get_dependencies(file_path="/src/services/user.py")

# Analyze the full dependency graph
analysis = client.analyze_graph()

# Find dead code (unreferenced symbols)
dead_code = client.detect_dead_code()
```

---

## Using as a Builder Subprocess

When the Super Orchestrator spawns agent-team-v15 as a builder, it passes scoped context via CLI arguments and environment variables:

```bash
# The Super Orchestrator invokes builders like this:
python -m agent_team \
  --prd .super-orchestrator/services/user-service/REQUIREMENTS.md \
  --config .super-orchestrator/builder-config.yaml \
  --cwd .super-orchestrator/services/user-service \
  --no-interview \
  --depth thorough
```

### Environment Variables for Super Team Integration

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SUPER_TEAM_CONTRACT_URL` | Contract Engine service URL (default: `http://localhost:8002`) |
| `SUPER_TEAM_CODEBASE_URL` | Codebase Intelligence service URL (default: `http://localhost:8003`) |
| `SUPER_TEAM_SERVICE_NAME` | Name of the service being built (e.g., `user-service`) |
| `SUPER_TEAM_RUN_ID` | Pipeline run identifier for state correlation |

### Builder Lifecycle

1. **Super Orchestrator** decomposes the PRD via Architect MCP into a ServiceMap
2. For each service in the ServiceMap, a **builder subprocess** is spawned
3. The builder receives a scoped REQUIREMENTS.md with only its service's requirements
4. The builder runs the full convergence loop (plan, code, review, debug, test)
5. On completion, the builder registers its contracts with the Contract Engine
6. The Super Orchestrator proceeds to integration testing once all builders finish

---

## Configuration for the Super Team Pipeline

When running as a builder in the Super Team pipeline, use these recommended config overrides:

```yaml
# builder-config.yaml (recommended for Super Team pipeline)
orchestrator:
  model: "opus"
  max_turns: 500
  max_budget_usd: 50.0      # Per-builder budget cap

depth:
  default: "thorough"        # Match the Super Orchestrator depth setting

convergence:
  max_cycles: 10
  escalation_threshold: 3

interview:
  enabled: false             # Builders skip the interview phase

milestone:
  enabled: false             # Milestones are handled at the Super Orchestrator level

verification:
  enabled: true
  blocking: true

post_orchestration_scans:
  mock_data_scan: true
  ui_compliance_scan: false  # UI compliance handled at integration level
  api_contract_scan: true    # Critical for cross-service compatibility
  max_scan_fix_passes: 1

mcp_servers:
  context7:
    enabled: true
  firecrawl:
    enabled: false           # Research done at orchestrator level
```

### Key Configuration Notes

- **`interview.enabled: false`** -- The Super Orchestrator handles requirements gathering; builders should not re-interview
- **`milestone.enabled: false`** -- Each builder handles a single service; milestone orchestration is managed by the Super Orchestrator
- **`api_contract_scan: true`** -- Essential for catching field mismatches before the integration phase
- **`max_budget_usd`** -- Set a per-builder cap to prevent runaway costs; the Super Orchestrator has its own global budget limit
